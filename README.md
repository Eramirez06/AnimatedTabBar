The project it's implemented on TypeScript in a major part well implemented but there are a few things that I leave in not the best because of the time

absolute paths are configures, also it as a easy folder estructure that facilitate the escalability 
the navigation it's handle by a single file avoiding this way have to send navigation as a param to child compoents
Also important part I was not able to complete the animation exactly like in the Gif because of the time but I did something "similar"
